###bash-logging
============

### Description
Bash packages compiled with logging enabled. There are both RedHat and Ubuntu (Debian) packages in this location. The only item modified during the compile process is the flag within config-top.h that turns on bash logging. All shell input will be logged to /var/log/messages (for RedHat) or /var/log/syslog (for Ubuntu).
